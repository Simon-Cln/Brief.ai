Critique of Technology (Industry)
The critique of technology, particularly in the industrial age, spans across ideological divides. On the left, thinkers like Saint-Simon, Fourier, Godin, and Karl Marx emphasized the concept of proletariat, focusing on labor and industrial consequences. On the right, figures like Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) approached it from environmental perspectives, exploring the intersection of technology and nature.

Ontology in this context is described as the "science of being", focusing on the essence and existence of entities within these frameworks.

Being and Time (1927) - Sein und Zeit
In Heidegger’s seminal work Sein und Zeit (Being and Time), three major elements emerge when discussing technology and intelligence:

The machine, a core technological artifact.
The evolution of the term intelligence, which gained prominence around 1940 and continues to dominate discussions to this day.
The idea of the semblable (the similar), representing relationships between entities in a technological and existential framework.
Reflections on the Expression "Artificial Intelligence"
The term "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) invites multiple layers of reflection:

The word "intelligence" itself:
In its French origin, it conveys a rich history of meaning tied to understanding and action.
In English, the term evolved to represent the flow and communication of information, as well as specific uses in espionage and general knowledge.
The adjective "artificial", highlighting the constructed or synthetic nature of AI.
Etymology of "Intelligence"
The word intelligence originates from the Latin term intelligere, which combines "inter" (between) and "ligere" (to gather). Its roots in the Greek verb "lego" carry meanings such as to collect, to harvest, or to traverse space, and even to read.

In essence, intelligence involves making choices—mental selection between different possibilities. In Christian Latin, the term expanded to describe:

A spiritual being.
Ideas of agreement and closeness.
This dual meaning encapsulates both understanding and action, emphasizing intelligence as both a cognitive and a relational concept.

Intelligence in English
In English, the word intelligence evolved to signify information that circulates, is received, and communicated. By the 1980s, it had taken on a specific connotation in espionage, representing secret information gathered by spies. Beyond this, it also retains its broader definition of general information or common understanding.
